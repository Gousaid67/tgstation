changes: 
  - refactor: "Ballistic guns have been almost entirely reworked from a backend side. This primarily focused on moving as much as possible into the base ballistic gun and turning as many other guns into essentially varedits as possible."
  - rscadd: "Guns can now be racked. This is the default action unless the magazine is empty."
  - rscadd: "Guns now can have the magazine removed by clicking on them with an open hand while they are in hand."
  - tweak: "Suppressors are now removed by alt clicking instead of clicking with an open hand"
  - rscadd: "Guns now have various bolt types that all function a bit differently. Open bolts cannot have a bullet chambered with no mag, locking bolts lock back after running out of ammo, etc."
  - rscadd: "All ballistic gun sounds are controlled by variables instead of hardcoded usages."
  - tweak: "The l6 LMG has a reworked control scheme. alt + click to open and close the cover, open hand to remove mag, place mag in by slapping them together, default action is rack."
  - tweak: "Functionality that used to be snowflake code such as tactical reloads has been moved to the base gun, and can be toggled by variables."
  - refactor: "All shotguns are now properly subpaths of the shotgun type. They still work the same."
  - imagedel: "Gun sprites have been almost entirely overhauled to use overlays instead of states. This collapsed the L6 sprite from 20 sprites to 9 sprites to give an example."
  - soundadd: "Remixed versions of the shotgun and base gun firesound"
  - soundadd: "New rifle firesound for l6 and moist nugget, new SMG fire sound, new sniper fire sound."
  - soundadd: "Lots of new weapon operation sounds such as racking and bolts and the like."
  - imageadd: "New sprites for the Riot Shotgun, Combat Shotgun, c20r, Deagle, m90, double barrel shotgun and 1911 by Memager."
  - imageadd: "All gun sprites that were pointing to the left have been flipped to point to the right."
  - balance: "Shotguns now can be pumped faster."
  - balance: "Bulldog can now be tac reloaded"
  - balance: "Sawn off shotguns now have an accuracy penalty and recoil"
